Preparation

Create a vulnerable EC2 instance for each team with the necessary forensic challenges and tools pre-installed. This instance will serve as the target for forensic analysis.


Challenge Scenarios

Prepare different forensic scenarios, each associated with a specific EC2 instance. For example, one scenario could involve a malware infection, another a data breach, and another a network intrusion.


Write a detailed challenge description for each scenario. Include background information about the incident, such as when it occurred and the suspected nature of the attack.

Tool Usage

Specify which forensic tools participants should use for each scenario. For instance, you can recommend using Volatility for memory analysis, Autopsy for disk forensics, or Wireshark for packet analysis.

Evidence collection

Populate the EC2 instances with evidence related to the respective scenarios. This may include disk images, memory dumps, log files, and other artifacts.
