# Challange Ideas

### How to use:
- please use markdown language
- write down as much detail as possible
- separate each challange under it's own subheading
- add a note stating whether it would be part of the EC2 instance (e.g. linux privesc challange) or part of the S3 bucket available via FTP/SFTP (e.g. steganographic image)

## Example Challange
**Category**: Linux Privesc
**Details**: using missconfigured SUID of Lua
**Note**: part of EC2 instance
